# Success Motivational Quotes

#### A simple but amazing package having more than 2000 motivational quotes. Get amazing quotes categorized by author names and categories.

### Motivation

These quotes were collected for a mobile app I created with React Native. After the app developed, I realized there should be a package for quotes which can be used to get famous quotes. If you want to download the app, here is the **[link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reactnativetemplatequotes)** for android users.

**Check [this](https://github.com/Sanan4li/success-motivational-quotes)** repository for source code of the package.
